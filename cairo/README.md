# Cairo Bootcamp

## Setup:

[Protostar](https://docs.swmansion.com/protostar/docs/tutorials/installation)

## To solve an exercise:

1. Run `$ protostar test test/test_ex*.cairo` to see a failing test.
1. Solve the exercise `exercise/ex*.cairo`
1. Run `$ protostar test test/test_ex*.cairo` to see a passing test.

**All tests should pass without any modification of the test files.**

**Hence you must only modify the `.cairo` files in the `/exercises/` directory.**
