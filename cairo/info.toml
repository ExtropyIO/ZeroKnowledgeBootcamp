We know about variables and mutability, but there is another important type of
variable available: constants.
Constants are always immutable and they are declared with keyword 'const' rather
than keyword 'let'.
Constants types must also always be annotated.
You can read about the constants here: https://cairo-book.github.io/ch02-01-variables-and-mutability.html?highlight=const#constants

You'll need to make a pattern to bind `name` and `age` to the appropriate parts

If you're familiar with Rust, you should know that Cairo has a similar syntax to 
destructure tuples into multiple variables.

There are multiple integer types in Cairo. You can read about them here:
https://cairo-book.github.io/ch02-02-data-types.html#integer-types
If you try to sum two integers and the result is bigger than the biggest integer of this type, you'll get a compilation error.
You can convert integers to felts using the `.into()` method. Make sure that you imported the `Into` trait.
You can convert felts to integers using the `.try_into()` method. Make sure that you imported the `TryInto` trait.
This method will return an `Option` type, so you'll need to unwrap it. To use the `unwrap()` method, you'll need to import the `OptionTrait` trait.
Take a look at the top of the file to see how these traits are imported.
